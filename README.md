ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Abhiram

ðŸ”­ I recently worked as a Data Science Intern @ GTechnologies (Fall 2024), where I improved patient data quality to 96%, cut manual entry time by 45%, and boosted clinical decision-making by 35%.

ðŸŒ± At Indiana University, I served as a Research & Teaching Assistant, building an AI-powered Canvas assistant (RAG + ChatGPT) that supported 500+ students, while also mentoring peers in Python programming.

ðŸ’¼ Previously, I contributed at Infosys & Acel Solutions, optimizing SQL pipelines (-40% runtime) and automating ETL/APIs (+30% efficiency) to streamline large-scale data systems.

ðŸ¤– My projects include a Parkinsonâ€™s detection ML pipeline (85% accuracy) and an E-commerce delivery forecasting model, showcasing my skills in machine learning and applied analytics.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Engineering projects.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about end-to-end data workflows, ML pipelines, and impactful data visualizations.
